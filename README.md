# UFOs

##Overview

For this project we are utilizing an HTML page with a table that will pull information from a javascript data file using filters to provide a more in-depth look into UFO sightings. The filters allow us to use have more particular search parameters.

## Results

With the website created, users can see UFO data from a javascript document. They have the ability to filter data based on 5 different criteria. The filters then pull the corresponding data and presents it in the table. 

##Summary

The webpage is functional. One drawback is that it is not connected to realtime data, and so users may not be seeing the most current information. A couple ways to further develop this would be to add the ability to pull new data from other sources and add more specific data to each sighting for verification purposes.
